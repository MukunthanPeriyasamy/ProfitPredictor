# **ProfitPredictor**

## **Project Overview**

**ProfitPredictor** is a multiple linear regression model designed to predict the profit of a startup company based on their R&D, Administration, and Marketing costs. This project takes you through the steps of preparing the data, training the model, and making predictions on new data.

## **Contents**

1. **Reading the Dataset**
   - Import and load the dataset containing the R&D, Administration, and Marketing costs along with the Profit of various startups.

2. **One-Hot Encoding**
   - Convert categorical data (if any, such as the country of the startup) into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

3. **Splitting the Dataset**
   - Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set to evaluate the model's performance. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to assess its accuracy.

4. **Training the Multiple Linear Regression Model**
   - Train the model on the training data, which includes R&D, Administration, and Marketing costs as independent variables, to predict the Profit.

5. **Predicting the Test Results**
   - Use the trained model to predict the profit for the test set and compare the predicted values with the actual profits.

## **Installation**

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (optional, if you want to visualize results)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## **Usage**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProfitPredictor.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ProfitPredictor
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   - Open the script file in your Python IDE or text editor.
   - Run the script to execute the steps outlined above.

4. **View Results:**
   - After running the script, the model will display the predicted profits alongside the actual profits from the test set.
